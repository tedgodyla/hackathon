# Hackathon Teddypy
The Teddypy was a project for 3FM Serious Request and Red Cross. We had to come up with idea's to help children in conflict areas. The Teddypy is a stuffed animal that children receive, and they may adorn. The teddypy parts are made ​​by people all over the world.

The hackathon lasted 24 hours. Our excuses for the somewhat messy code.
