# Hackathon Teddypy
The Teddypy was a project for 3FM Serious Request and Red Cross. We had to come up with idea's to help children in conflict areas. The Teddypy is a stuffed animal that children receive, and they may adorn. The teddypy parts are made ​​by people all over the world.

The hackathon lasted 24 hours. We didn't win the hackathon, but it was really fun to be part of it. Ow.. and our excuses for the somewhat messy code.
